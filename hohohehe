Walking through the halls we wait
looking at our watch.
You see a kid depressed 
he looks off but a notch.
You see his shoes so pumped,
so shiny and so rare.
Your kicks are so ratty,
so ugly and so pale.
You see him open his bag
you wonder whats inside.
A gun he pulls out kick
it's time to run and hide.
