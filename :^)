'Twas the fortnite before Christmas,
when all through the bus
Not a player was dancing
not even a default;
The chests were glowing
by the houes with loot,
In hopes that John Wick
soon would be there;
The gamers were crying
all breaking their screens,
While visions of V-Bucks
shot them in the head.

-Barack Hussein Obama
