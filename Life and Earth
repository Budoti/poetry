Let me tell you something about earth
About the curiosuity, desire, and drive to want more
To see the Northern lights of Iceland or to walk on the scortching sands of Egypt
There's an entire planet that is undiscovered and that planet is the one that you walk on with your own two feet
People say you have your entire life to discover new things
In the big picture, one day you will look back at all the places you could've gone and all the things you could've done differently
And one day your life will flash before your eyes so make sure it's worht watching
