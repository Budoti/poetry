The hood could be good.
The hood wanted to be good.
There were some no-good hoods.
With some no-good woods.
But the hood wanted to be good even if there were no redwoods.
The hood of course understood where it stood.
The hood didn't want to be misunderstood but knew that it would.
The hood knew some people were still in boyhood.
The hood knew that they didn't understand brotherhood.
The hood knew that they would one day be a good neighborhood and a good neighborhood was a good hood.
It would be the good hood who could.
